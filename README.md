Async-race - SPA project to manage the collection of the cars, operate its engines, and show races statistics.

To launch the application, you must:

1. Download the mock server: https://github.com/mikhama/async-race-api
2. Install dependencies with the npm install command and run it with the npm start command
3. Open the application by following the link: https://zhannach-async-race.netlify.app/

I got such skills when was working with the project:
- Ð¡ommunication with a server (fetch, REST API)
- Async coding / Promises
- JS Animations
- DOM Api
